## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Excel, with a focus on identifying factors that lead to high churn rates and developing strategies for customer retention. The analysis is displayed in an interactive dashboard, allowing easy exploration of churn trends and customer segments.

## Data Description

- **Dataset**: Contains customer data, including demographics, usage details, and churn indicators.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `Customer ID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - `Churn`: Indicates whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
  - `Intl Plan`: Whether the customer has subscribed to an international plan.
  - `State`: The U.S. state in which the customer resides.
  - `Age Group`, `Data Usage`, `Contract Type`: Additional attributes for segmenting customers and analyzing churn.

## Project Goals

1. **Identify high-risk customer segments** to help target retention efforts.
2. **Determine the primary reasons for churn** based on competitive, demographic, and usage factors.
3. **Provide actionable recommendations** for reducing churn through targeted strategies.

## Key Insights

- **Senior Citizens’ Churn**: Senior citizens exhibit a higher churn rate than other age groups, making them a critical segment for retention.
- **High Churn States**: Certain states, like CA, IN, and NH, show significantly higher churn rates compared to the national average.
- **Competitor Influence**: Customers often churn due to competitors offering better devices, higher data limits, or faster speeds.
- **International Plan Variations**: Customers with international plans show mixed churn patterns, potentially due to pricing or service options.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Develop Retention Plans for Senior Citizens**  
   - Since senior citizens have a high churn rate, creating senior-focused plans with simple options, dedicated support, and potential discounts could improve retention.

2. **Target High-Churn States**  
   - Focus retention and loyalty programs in states with high churn rates (e.g., CA, IN, NH). These could include special offers, customer service improvements, and state-specific incentives.

3. **Enhance Competitive Features**  
   - Improve offerings by analyzing competitors, especially in terms of device options, speed, and data allowances. Adjust service packages to make them more appealing in high-churn regions.

4. **Optimize International Plans**  
   - Expand affordable, high-quality international plan options for customers who need them, particularly in states with higher churn among this segment.
